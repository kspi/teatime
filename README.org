** Usage
   Run /make/ to compile. The executable is called /teatime/. To
   install, copy it somewhere in your /PATH/.

   You can pass a the time as a command-line option in format
   /minutes/ or /minutes:seconds/ or /:seconds/. Then the countdown is
   started immediately. Otherwise the time period can be chosen
   interactively.

   In the interactive interface, aside from using the graphical
   buttons, the time period can also be changed using the arrow keys
   on the keyboard. The countdown can be started with the /Enter/ or
   /Space/ keys.

   When the countdown is complete, the program shows a notification
   box. Depending on the system configuration, this may emit a sound.
