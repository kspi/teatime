## Usage

Run *make* to compile. The executable is called *teatime*. To
install, copy it somewhere in your *PATH*.

You can pass a the time as a command-line option in format
*minutes* or *minutes:seconds* or *:seconds*. Then the countdown is
started immediately. Otherwise the time period can be chosen
interactively.

In the interactive interface, aside from using the graphical
buttons, the time period can also be changed using the arrow keys
on the keyboard. The countdown can be started with the *Enter* or
*Space* keys.

When the countdown is complete, the program shows a notification
box. Depending on the system configuration, this may emit a sound.


## Dependencies

- GTK+ 3.0
- Vala 0.12.0 if compiling from Git repository
